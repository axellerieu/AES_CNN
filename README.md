# AES_CNN

This project aims to create a micro-server utilizing UART on a Zybo z7
development board. The micro-server will enable users to obtain the predictions of a
Convolutional Neural Network on an MNIST image, through the use of pre-trained
weights and biases.

Part of an SDK project (including system architecture, libraries and other required files to make it functional on the fpga).
